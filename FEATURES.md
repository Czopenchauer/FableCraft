# FableCraft Features

## Planned

- [ ] Docker volume bulk file copy optimization
- [ ] RagClient fallback - auto-create container on failed connection if not found
- [ ] Docker volume import/export - share indexed worldbooks between instances
- [ ] Persistent library for characters, world settings, and progression systems - reuse across adventures without manual file handling
