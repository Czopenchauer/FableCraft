# Progression Quick Reference

## Skills vs. Mage Rank

**Individual Skills** have proficiency levels tracked with XP:
- Fire Magic (Journeyman, 450 XP)
- Healing (Apprentice, 180 XP)
- Barrier Magic (Novice, 60 XP)

**Mage Rank** is your professional/social standingâ€”essentially your *highest* magical skill:
- If your best skill is Fire Magic at Journeyman, you're a "Journeyman Mage" or "Journeyman Fire Mage"
- Secondary skills at lower levels don't reduce your rank

**Spell requirements check the relevant skill, not overall rank:**
- A Major fire spell requires Adept-level *Fire Magic*
- Being an Adept Healer doesn't help you cast fire spellsâ€”wrong skill
- Generalists (multiple high skills) are rare and respected

## Required Skills by Path

### Mage Path

**Required:**
- **Mana Manipulation** — Determines mana pool size and spell cost reduction. Without this, you run out of fuel quickly.
- **At least one magical discipline** — Fire Magic, Water Magic, Healing, Barrier Magic, etc. This is what you actually *do* with your mana.

**Optional but common:**
- Secondary magical discipline (most mages develop 1-2 supporting skills)
- Basic combat skill (for self-defense when spells aren't appropriate)

**Example Mage Skills:**
```
Mana Manipulation: Journeyman (150 pool, Minor spells free)
Fire Magic: Journeyman (primary discipline)
Barrier Magic: Novice (defensive backup)
```

### Warrior Path

**Required:**
- **Body Reinforcement** — Determines passive physical enhancement. This is your core combat capability.
- **Mana Manipulation** — Still needed for technique cost reduction and weapon channeling. Warriors with low MM burn through their pool fast when using techniques.
- **At least one combat skill** — Swordplay, Spearwork, Archery, Unarmed Combat, etc. BR makes you superhuman; combat skills determine what you *do* with that.

**Optional but common:**
- Secondary combat skill (versatility)
- Basic survival/tactical skills

**Example Warrior Skills:**
```
Body Reinforcement: Skilled (significantly superhuman passive state)
Mana Manipulation: Apprentice (80 pool, Basic techniques free)
Swordplay: Skilled (primary weapon)
```

### Hybrid Path (Spellblade/Battle Mage)

**Required:**
- **Body Reinforcement** — For passive enhancement and technique foundation
- **Mana Manipulation** — Higher priority than pure paths; fuels both spells and techniques
- **At least one magical discipline** — For hybrid elemental techniques
- **At least one combat skill** — For actual fighting proficiency

**Why it's rare:** Four skills minimum, all need significant development. Most people specialize.

**Example Hybrid Skills:**
```
Body Reinforcement: Competent (noticeably superhuman)
Mana Manipulation: Journeyman (150 pool, covers both paths)
Fire Magic: Apprentice (for flame-blade techniques)
Swordplay: Skilled (primary weapon)
```

### Non-Combatant

Characters who aren't primarily fighters or mages still benefit from:
- **Mana Manipulation at Novice** — Basic mana sensitivity, tiny pool for emergencies
- **Relevant professional skills** — Crafting, Social, Knowledge skills per their role

## Magical Ranks & XP Thresholds

| Rank | Cumulative XP | XP to Next | Description |
|------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Untrained | 0 | 50 | No formal training; cannot cast |
| Novice | 50 | 100 | Can sense mana, basic exercises, cantrips |
| Apprentice | 150 | 250 | Competent basic spells in one element |
| Journeyman | 400 | 600 | Professional level; can work for hire |
| Adept | 1000 | 1500 | Expert in primary, competent in secondary |
| Master | 2500 | 3500 | Exceptional ability; teaches, innovates |
| Archmage | 6000 | â€” | Theoretical limits; ~dozen alive continent-wide |

**Note:** These thresholds apply to primary magical skills (Fire Magic, Healing, Barrier Magic, etc.). Non-magical skills use the same XP values but different rank names where appropriate.

---

## Mana Manipulation Skill

Mana Manipulation is a separate skill that governs your internal pool size, ambient channeling efficiency, and recovery rate. Your spell skills (Fire Magic, Healing, etc.) determine *what* you can cast; Mana Manipulation determines *how much fuel* you have.

### Internal Pool by Mana Manipulation Rank

| Mana Manipulation Rank | Internal Pool |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Untrained | 15 |
| Novice | 40 |
| Apprentice | 80 |
| Journeyman | 150 |
| Adept | 250 |
| Master | 400 |
| Archmage | 600+ |

### Ambient Channeling (Spell Cost Reduction)

Higher Mana Manipulation ranks let you passively draw ambient mana to cover lower-tier spells. This makes weaker spells cheaper or free.

| Mana Manipulation Rank | Free (0 cost) | Half Cost | Full Cost |
|------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Novice | â€” | â€” | All spells |
| Apprentice | Cantrips | â€” | Minor+ |
| Journeyman | Cantrips | Minor | Standard+ |
| Adept | Cantrips, Minor | Standard | Major+ |
| Master | Cantrips, Minor, Standard | Major | Grand+ |
| Archmage | Cantrips through Major | Grand | Legendary |

**Example:** A Master throwing fireballs (Standard tier, normally 30-50 mana) pays nothingâ€”ambient channeling covers it. The same Master casting a Grand spell pays full price from their pool.

**Mana-poor environments:** Shift the table one column right. Freeâ†’Half, Halfâ†’Full, Fullâ†’Full. Masters suddenly pay for Standard spells.

### Tracking Format

```
Mana: 85/150
```

Subtract spell cost (adjusted for channeling). Add recovery during rest. Update after each scene.

---

## Spell Tiers & Costs

| Tier | Mana Cost | Min. Rank | Examples |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Cantrip | 2-5 | Untrained* | Light, spark, minor cleaning, sense mana |
| Minor | 10-20 | Novice | Firebolt, minor heal, gust, water manipulation |
| Standard | 30-50 | Apprentice | Fireball, serious healing, barrier, flight |
| Major | 80-150 | Adept | Large-area effects, complex enchantments, telekinesis |
| Grand | 200-400 | Master | Battlefield magic, permanent enchantments, teleportation |
| Legendary | 500+ | Archmage | City-scale effects, dimensional magic, feats approaching miracle |

*Cantrips can be attempted by anyone with mana sensitivity but are unreliable without Novice rank.

**Casting above rank:** Possible but dangerous. -2 tier penalty to effectiveness, high failure chance, risk of backlash.

## XP Award System

### Base XP by Usage Duration

| Usage Type | Base XP |
|------------|---------|
| Brief (single action/spell) | 15 |
| Standard (scene-length activity) | 20 |
| Extended (prolonged engagement) | 25 |

### Challenge Multiplier

| Task Difficulty vs. Current Rank | Multiplier |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| Far below (trivial) | Ã—0 |
| Below (easy) | Ã—0.1 |
| At level (appropriate challenge) | Ã—1.0 |
| Above (difficult) | Ã—1.5 |
| Far above (should be impossible) | Ã—2.0 |

### Bonus Multipliers (Additive)

| Condition | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Life-or-death stakes | +25% to +50% |
| Emotionally significant | +25% to +50% |
| Learning from superior (2+ ranks above) | +25% |
| Innovative/creative application | +25% |
| Relevant positive trait (e.g., Mana Sensitivity) | +25% to +50% |
| Relevant negative trait | âˆ’25% to âˆ’50% |
| Teaching while performing | +15% |

### Outcome Modifier

| Result | XP Percentage |
|--------|---------------|
| Success | 100% |
| Partial success | 75% |
| Failure with learning | 50% |
| Failure without reflection | 25% |
| Survived catastrophic failure | 50-75% |

### Formula
```
Final XP = Base Ã— Challenge Multiplier Ã— (1 + Sum of Bonus Modifiers) Ã— Outcome Modifier
```

### Example Calculation
Apprentice fire mage attempts a difficult (Above level) spell in combat (life-or-death, +50%) while being coached by an Adept (+25%). Partial success.

```
Base: 20 (standard scene use)
Challenge: Ã—1.5 (above level)
Bonuses: +50% (stakes) + 25% (superior teaching) = +75%
Outcome: Ã—0.75 (partial success)

Final: 20 Ã— 1.5 Ã— 1.75 Ã— 0.75 = 39 XP
```

## Mana Exhaustion Effects

| Internal Reserve | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| 75%+ | None |
| 50-75% | Mild fatigue; -1 tier to fine control |
| 25-50% | Significant fatigue; casting speed halved |
| 10-25% | Severe fatigue; only Cantrips reliable |
| Below 10% | Critical; risk of unconsciousness per cast |
| 0% | Collapse; further casting causes permanent damage |

**Recovery Rates (Internal Mana):**

| Activity | Recovery |
|----------|----------|
| Sleep | Full recovery (8 hours) |
| Rest (awake, inactive) | 15% per hour |
| Light activity | 8% per hour |
| Active (walking, conversation) | 5% per hour |
| Strenuous (combat, travel) | 0% (or negative if casting) |
| Meditation (trained) | 25% per hour |

## Progression Timeline Estimates

Assuming consistent challenging practice, mentor access, and ~3-4 meaningful skill uses per in-game week:

| Transition | Approximate Time |
|------------|------------------|
| Untrained â†’ Novice | 1-2 months |
| Novice â†’ Apprentice | 3-6 months |
| Apprentice â†’ Journeyman | 1-2 years |
| Journeyman â†’ Adept | 3-5 years |
| Adept â†’ Master | 8-15 years |
| Master â†’ Archmage | 20-50+ years |

**Accelerators:** Exceptional talent traits, life-or-death practice, superior instruction, mana-rich environments.

**Decelerators:** Safe/unchallenging practice, no instruction, mana-poor environments, relevant negative traits.

## Non-Magical Skill Ranks

For skills without magical ranking tradition:

| Rank | Cumulative XP | Equivalent |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Untrained | 0 | No experience |
| Novice | 50 | Hobbyist, beginner |
| Competent | 150 | Functional professional |
| Skilled | 400 | Experienced professional |
| Expert | 1000 | Among the best locally |
| Master | 2500 | Regional reputation |
| Legendary | 6000 | Continental recognition |

## Body Reinforcement (The Path of Steel)

Warriors use the same mana system as mages, applied inward rather than outward. Where mages externalize mana as spells, warriors internalize it for physical enhancement. Body Reinforcement is the core martial skill governing this discipline.

### Core Concept

Body Reinforcement training permanently alters how mana flows through the body. Your BR rank determines your *passive, always-on* physical enhancement—no mana cost, no maintenance. This is simply what you are now.

| BR Rank | Passive State |
|---------|---------------|
| Untrained | Normal human |
| Novice | Slight edge—sharper reflexes, tires slower, hits harder |
| Competent | Noticeably superhuman—faster than unenhanced eyes track, shrugs off blows that would stagger normal people |
| Skilled | Significantly superhuman—arrows feel slow, blades have trouble biting, can crack stone with strikes |
| Expert | Extremely enhanced—deflect blades barehanded, leap buildings, move faster than most can react |
| Master | Near-magical—skin turns weapons, speed approaches teleportation, strength matches siege equipment |
| Legendary | Matches Archmages—body is effectively a magical construct in durability and capability |

**This enhancement is free and constant.** A Master warrior wakes up superhuman. The years of training have permanently restructured their mana channels.

### Mana Pool for Warriors

Warriors use the same Mana Manipulation skill and internal pool as mages. However, mana is spent only on:
- **Active Techniques:** Burst abilities with specific effects
- **Weapon Channeling:** Pushing mana through blade for enhanced cutting power
- **Elemental Integration:** Hybrid techniques combining BR with magical disciplines

A warrior with an empty pool is still enhanced by their BR rank—they just can't use techniques. Compare: a mage with an empty pool is just a tired person who knows theory.

### Martial Techniques

Learned combat forms that consume mana for specific effects:

| Technique Tier | Mana Cost | Min. BR Rank | Examples |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Basic | 5-10 | Novice | Reinforced strike, quick-step, blade-catch |
| Intermediate | 15-30 | Competent | Short blade projection, multi-strike, shockwave stomp |
| Advanced | 50-90 | Skilled | Spell deflection, ranged air-cut, iron body |
| Master | 150-250 | Expert | Wide-area blade wave, ground-shatter, afterimage |
| Legendary | 400-600 | Master | Techniques matching Grand/Legendary spells in impact |

### Ambient Channeling for Techniques

Same Mana Manipulation efficiency applies to technique costs:

| MM Rank | Free Techniques | Half-Cost | Full Cost |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Novice | — | — | All |
| Apprentice | Basic | — | Intermediate+ |
| Journeyman | Basic | Intermediate | Advanced+ |
| Adept | Basic, Intermediate | Advanced | Master+ |
| Master | Through Advanced | Master | Legendary |
| Archmage | Through Master | Legendary | — |

**Example:** A Master warrior with Master MM throws Advanced techniques for free all day. Only Master-tier moves cost them anything meaningful.

### Weapon Channeling

Your body has adapted to channel mana. Your weapon hasn't. Pushing cutting power beyond the blade's natural capability requires active mana flow through the weapon.

| Weapon Quality | Mana/Minute | Max Enhancement | Technique Limit | Typical Cost |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Mundane iron | 8 | Light | Basic only | 5-20 marks |
| Quality steel | 5 | Moderate | Intermediate | 50-200 marks |
| Mana-forged steel | 2 | Heavy | Advanced | 2,000-8,000 marks |
| Enchanted (minor) | 0 | Extreme | Master | 5,000-15,000 marks |
| Enchanted (quality) | 0 | Extreme+ | Master | 15,000-40,000 marks |
| Legendary materials | 0 (amplifies) | Absolute | Legendary | 50,000+ marks |

**Failure modes:** Pushing past material limit causes the weapon to crack, then shatter. Dangerous shrapnel, lost investment. Using elemental techniques with non-conductive weapons damages the blade (fire through iron = warped sword).

**Implication:** A Master warrior with a mundane sword is still personally superhuman, but their weapon can't keep up. Master-level strength through a blade that only handles Light enhancement = shattered weapon.

### Elemental Techniques (Hybrid Path)

Warriors with both Body Reinforcement AND an elemental magic skill can develop hybrid techniques. These are visible (fire shows flames, lightning crackles) unlike pure BR enhancement.

**Examples by Element:**

*Fire + BR:* Burning Blade (flames along weapon), Heat Body (radiate intense heat), Explosion Step (fire-boosted burst movement)

*Lightning + BR:* Thunder Strike (shock damage + muscle spasms), Storm Nerves (accelerated reactions), Shock Grip (contact zaps)

*Earth + BR:* Stone Skin (visible rock hardening, extreme defense, reduced mobility), Quake Stomp (ground-shatter), Weight Shift (become immovable)

*Wind + BR:* Cutting Wind (blade extends with air edge), Feather Step (near-weightlessness, silent movement), Gale Force (wind-boosted strikes)

**Hybrid Technique Costs:**

| Hybrid Tier | Mana Cost | Required Ranks |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Basic Elemental | 8-15 | Novice BR + Novice Element |
| Intermediate Elemental | 25-45 | Competent BR + Apprentice Element |
| Advanced Elemental | 70-120 | Skilled BR + Journeyman Element |
| Master Elemental | 180-300 | Expert BR + Adept Element |

### Technique Acquisition

**Learning established techniques:**
- Military training (standardized, reliable)
- Guild instruction (veterans teach proven combat forms)
- Martial schools (regional/cultural traditions with signature styles)
- Manuals (less common than spell texts—martial knowledge transmits better through demonstration)

**Learning time:** Similar to spells. Basic techniques in days/weeks, Advanced in months, Master techniques take years.

**Developing new techniques:** Requires Expert+ BR, understanding of mana flow, extensive trial and error. Most "new" techniques are variations on existing forms. Genuinely novel techniques are rare and make reputations.

### Warrior vs. Mage Comparison

| Aspect | Warrior (Body Reinforcement) | Mage (Spellcasting) |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| Mana use | Techniques + weapon channeling | Discrete spell costs |
| Empty pool effect | Still enhanced, loses techniques | Loses everything |
| Range | Melee/close (must close distance) | Variable, often ranged |
| Gear dependency | High (weapon caps technique power) | Low (can cast unarmed) |
| Sustained combat | Favored (passive enhancement is free) | Burns pool over time |
| Alpha strike | Weaker (needs to close) | Stronger (open with big spell) |

**Scaling by rank:**

| Warrior Rank | Passive State | vs. Mage Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Novice | Slight edge | Loses to competent mages |
| Competent | Noticeably superhuman | Threatens Apprentices |
| Skilled | Significantly superhuman | Even with Journeymen in melee |
| Expert | Extremely enhanced | Threatens Adepts, advantage up close |
| Master | Near-magical | Matches Masters, favored in melee |
| Legendary | Archmage-equivalent | Even with Archmages |

### Visibility

Pure Body Reinforcement is invisible to normal sight. A Master warrior looks like anyone else until they move. Mana-sight reveals the enhancement—experienced mages can gauge a warrior's level by observing their mana flow.

Elemental techniques are visible: fire burns, lightning crackles, wind distorts air, stone textures skin.

## Quick Formulas

**XP to next rank:** Check table above (same thresholds for magical and non-magical skills)

### For Mages

**Can I cast this spell?** Compare spell tier minimum rank to your skill in that element. If below, dangerous attempt.

**What does this spell cost?** 
1. Check spell tier base cost
2. Check your Mana Manipulation rank on channeling table
3. Free = 0, Half = base ÷ 2, Full = base cost

**How much mana do I have?** Check Mana Manipulation rank for pool size.

### For Warriors

**What's my passive enhancement?** Check Body Reinforcement rank. This is always on, no cost.

**Can I use this technique?** Compare technique tier to your BR rank. If below minimum, can't execute it.

**What does this technique cost?**
1. Check technique tier base cost
2. Check your Mana Manipulation rank on technique channeling table
3. Free = 0, Half = base ÷ 2, Full = base cost

**Can my weapon handle this?** Check weapon quality vs. technique tier limit. If technique exceeds limit, weapon breaks.

**Weapon channeling drain:** Check weapon quality table for mana/minute cost. Enchanted weapons = 0 cost.

### General

**How long to level up?** (XP needed) ÷ (average XP per scene) = scenes needed. Assume 20-30 XP average with bonuses.
