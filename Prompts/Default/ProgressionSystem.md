## Skill Progression

### Proficiency Levels

Define the proficiency tiers and their XP thresholds:

| Level | Cumulative XP | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Untrained | 0 | No formal training or practice |
| Novice | 50 | Basic familiarity |
| Amateur | 150 | Some competence, still learning |
| Competent | 400 | Reliable professional level |
| Proficient | 900 | Skilled practitioner |
| Expert | 1900 | Exceptional ability |
| Master | 4400 | Among the best |
| Grandmaster | 9400 | Legendary mastery |

### XP Award Conditions

**Only award XP when:**
- Character meaningfully uses a skill (not trivial/routine)
- Task difficulty is at or above current Challenge Floor (= proficiency level)
- Character learns from failure at challenging tasks

### XP Calculation Formula
```
Final XP = Base XP × Challenge Multiplier × (1 + Sum of Bonus Multipliers)
```

**Base XP by Usage:**
| Usage Type | Base XP |
|------------|---------|
| Brief use (single action) | 15 |
| Standard use (scene-length) | 20 |
| Extended use (prolonged) | 25 |

**Challenge Multipliers:**
| Difficulty vs. Proficiency | Multiplier |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Far below level | 0% |
| Below level | 10% |
| At level | 100% |
| Above level | 150% |
| Far above level | 200% |

**Bonus Multipliers (Additive):**
| Condition | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| High stakes / life-death | +25% to +50% |
| Dramatic / emotionally charged | +25% to +50% |
| Learning from superior (2+ levels above) | +25% |
| Innovative application | +25% |
| Relevant positive trait | +25% to +50% |
| Relevant negative trait | -25% to -50% |
| Teaching while doing | +15% |

**Failure XP:**
| Outcome | XP Percentage |
|---------|---------------|
| Success | 100% |
| Partial success | 75% |
| Failure with learning | 50% |
| Failure without reflection | 25% |
| Catastrophic survival | 50-75% |

## Resource Systems

Define any regenerating or depletable resources the world uses (mana, stamina, etc.).

### [Resource Name]

**Pool Scaling:**
Describe how maximum pool scales with character power level.

**Regeneration Rates:**
| Activity State | Regeneration |
|----------------|--------------|
| Resting | X% per hour |
| Active | Y% per hour |
| Focused recovery | Z% per hour |

**Exhaustion Effects:**
| Resource Remaining | Effect |
|--------------------|--------|
| 75%+ | No effect |
| 50-75% | Mild effects |
| 25-50% | Significant effects |
| 10-25% | Severe effects |
| Below 10% | Critical effects |
| 0% | Collapse / inability to use |

## Power Advancement

Define any tier/level advancement system beyond skills.

### Advancement Requirements

Describe what's required to advance in power tier (if applicable).

### Training Methods

| Method | Progression Gained | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| [Method 1] | [Amount] | [Requirements/limitations] |
| [Method 2] | [Amount] | [Requirements/limitations] |

### Advancement Multipliers

| Condition | Multiplier |
|-----------|------------|
| [Favorable condition] | ×1.25 |
| [Unfavorable condition] | ×0.75 |

---

## Trait Acquisition

### Requirements

Traits require **significant, sustained experience**—not single events:
- Physical traits: Major injury, magical alteration, extended training
- Mental traits: Extended conditioning, significant trauma, intensive training
- Single dramatic events may *begin* trait development but rarely complete it

### Tracking Development

Track developing traits as progress toward completion:
- "X/Y experiences" 
- "X weeks/Y weeks conditioning"
- Percentage toward acquisition

---

## Time-Based Changes

When time passes, automatically update relevant needs/conditions:

| Need/Condition | Rate of Change | Notes |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Hunger | +1 per ~3 hours | Faster with activity |
| Thirst | +1 per ~2 hours | Faster with exertion |
| Fatigue | Varies | Based on activity level |
| [Other needs] | [Rate] | [Notes] |

---

## Consistency Rules

When updating progression:
1. **Show your math** - Include calculations for any XP or resource changes
2. **Justify changes** - Every update needs narrative justification
3. **Check thresholds** - Note when approaching or crossing level boundaries
4. **Track cumulative** - Always show current total, threshold, and remaining
