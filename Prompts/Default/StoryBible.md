## 1. Genre Identity

**Primary Genre**: Dark Fantasy Cultivation

**Secondary Elements**: 
- Survival — carving out your place in the world
- Erotica/Romance — lovers, sexual encounters as part of life
- Slice of Life — building a life during the 70% downtime
- Political Intrigue — sect dynamics, power structures, faction play
- Coming of Age/Growth — striving for power, finding yourself

**Tone Spectrum**:
- Grimdark ──◆──────────── Hopeful *(Brutal, but good people exist)*
- Serious ──◆──────────── Comedic
- Grounded ────◆────────── Mythic
- Cynical ────◆────────── Idealistic

**Touchstone Works**: 
"This story feels like **Mushoku Tensei meets Berserk**"

- Mushoku's slow character growth, integrated sexuality, detailed worldbuilding, and consequences that stick
- Berserk's unflinching brutality, the sense that the world will crush you if you're weak, and hope found in connections despite darkness

---

## 2. Consequence Philosophy

**World Harshness**: **Ironman**
No safety nets. Bad decisions kill. The world doesn't care about your story.

**What's On The Table**:
- Slavery
- Rape
- Losing all equipment
- Public humiliation
- Permanent maiming
- Death

**Failure Behavior**:
- Do failures cascade or stabilize? **Cascade, but with mercy beats for stabilization**
- Are there mercy beats after disaster? **Yes — consequences stem from logic, not random piling on**
- Can the MC lose everything? **Yes**

**The Causation Rule**:
Consequences must stem from:
- The world's established logic
- MC's actions and choices
- NPC actions based on their own motivations

Consequences should NOT come from:
- Random events piling on "just because"
- The narrative deciding MC needs to suffer
- Contrived coincidences designed to hurt MC

**The world does not revolve around the MC — neither to help nor to hurt.**

**Permanent Loss Table**:
| Can Be Lost | Yes/No | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Equipment/Resources | Yes | |
| Relationships/Allies | Yes | |
| Social Standing | Yes | |
| Body Parts/Function | Yes | |
| Freedom/Autonomy | Yes | Slavery is on the table |
| Identity/Self | Yes | |
| Life | Yes | |

## 3. Pacing Profile

**Action-to-Downtime Ratio**: **30/70**
Full action-packed stories become tiring quickly. Most of the story is living, building, connecting.

**Scene Cadence**: **Standard, on the longer side**
Scenes breathe and develop, but don't drag.

**Tension Curve**: **Slow burn with peaks and valleys**
Tension builds gradually over long arcs, punctuated by intense moments.

**Breathing Room Frequency**: **Earned**
- If MC is in the sect or creates a safe place, it should not be disturbed without reason
- Safe spaces are respected until something in the narrative logic threatens them
- The world should not constantly pile on the MC
- Rest is real when earned

**World Thread Pressure**:
- **Thread Urgency**: Background simmer with occasional acute crises
  - Most threads progress slowly, giving MC time to build their life
  - Occasionally a thread reaches critical and demands attention
  - The world moves whether MC engages or not, but it's not constantly screaming
- **Deadline Tightness**: Moderate to Loose
  - Tight deadlines feel wrong for slow burn
  - But deadlines exist — ignore something long enough and it resolves without you (possibly badly)
- **Overlapping Threats**: Sometimes
  - Usually MC can focus on one thing at a time
  - Occasionally life piles up and choices must be made
  - Rare "everything at once" moments for dramatic peaks

---

## 4. Resolution Philosophy

**Resolution Style**: **Simulationist**
Physics are physics. Creativity helps within realistic bounds. The world follows its own rules.

**Stat Respect**:
- How much can narrative momentum override mechanical disadvantage? **Sometimes — not often, but it's possible**
- Are desperate gambles rewarded or punished? **Gambles are gambles — sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. No bias either way.**
- Does "earned through suffering" grant narrative weight? **No. Suffering doesn't entitle you to success.**

**Contest Philosophy**:
- Outmatched MC vs. superior foe: **Can survive or win if clever enough, but be realistic**
- Social contests against betters: **Difficult but possible with the right approach**
- Can pure luck save the day? **Rarely, and not reliably**

**The Cleverness Clause**:
There should always be *a* way to survive or win if MC is clever enough — but:
- The solution must be realistic
- It must use established capabilities and resources
- "Clever" means actually clever, not "the narrative wanted you to win"

---

## 5. Prose Style

**Voice**: **Gritty/Raw**
Rough, unpolished, unflinching. The prose doesn't look away and doesn't prettify.

**Example of target voice**:
> Fucking fog again. Can barely see three feet ahead. I shoulder through a knot of inner disciples—they don't move for me, why would they—and catch the stink of blood on the air. Some poor bastard pushing too hard, too fast. I know the feeling. Three months in this place and I've learned exactly one thing: nobody here gives a shit if I live or die.

**Sentence Rhythm**: **Mixed**
Varied rhythm — punchy when tense, flowing when calm.

**Description Density**: **Moderate with purpose**
- Environment descriptions should let the reader imagine the world
- But not every forest and building needs a paragraph
- Describe what matters, skip what doesn't
- Make descriptions active, not static lists

**Interiority Depth**: **Moderate**
Thoughts surface naturally, not constant internal monologue. MC reflects but isn't navel-gazing.

**Sensory Priority**:
1. Visual — what MC sees
2. Emotional/Visceral — what MC feels (fear, anger, desire, pain)
3. Tactile — physical sensation when relevant
4. Auditory — sound when it matters
5. Olfactory — smell for atmosphere and grounding

**Physicality**: **Unflinching**
Pain is pain. Exhaustion is exhaustion. Hunger gnaws. Arousal is real. The body is present in the prose, not abstracted away.

## 6. Dialogue Style

**Formality Range**: **Varies by character**
- Dialogue should reflect the speaker's background, age, social standing, education
- A sect elder speaks differently than a street vendor
- A noble speaks differently than a slave
- A child speaks differently than a veteran cultivator

**Subtext Level**: **Moderate**
Some layering — people don't always say exactly what they mean, but it's not all riddles.

**Banter**: **Occasional, natural**
When it fits the characters and moment.

**Profanity**: **Present, character-appropriate**
Some characters curse freely, others never. Fits the person.

**Speeches/Monologues**: **Brief declarations only**
Actions speak. Villains don't explain their plans.

---

## 7. Thematic Core

**Central Themes**:
- **Survival and carving your place** — making a living in a world that doesn't owe you anything
- **Connection** — meeting friends, foes, and lovers; relationships that matter
- **Power and growth** — striving to be stronger, and what that costs
- **Freedom vs. security** — what would you sacrifice for safety? For power?

**The Central Question**:
"What will you become to survive and thrive in a world that doesn't care if you exist?"

**Moral Clarity**: **Gray morality**
Everyone has reasons. Good people do bad things. Bad people have understandable motivations. Right and wrong are often perspective.

**How Themes Surface**:
- Through consequences of MC choices
- Through NPC philosophies and conflicts
- Through the contrast between brutal world and genuine connections
- Through what MC is willing to do — and not do — to survive

## 8. Content Calibration

**Everything is on the table. No hard limits.**

| Category | Level | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Violence | Unflinching | |
| Gore/Body Horror | Unflinching | |
| Sexuality | Unflinching | Integrated into world, not gratuitous |
| Sexual Violence | Unflinching | Treated with weight, not glossed |
| Slavery/Dehumanization | Unflinching | |
| Torture | Unflinching | |
| Psychological Horror | Unflinching | |
| Child Endangerment | Described | Present in world but not gratuitous |
| Self-Harm | Unflinching | |

**Fade-to-Black Triggers**: None specified

**Hard Limits**: None

**Content Handling Note**:
"Unflinching" means the prose doesn't look away or sanitize — but it also doesn't wallow. 
- Dark content is shown with the gravity it deserves
- Not gratuitous or fetishized (unless a character's perspective makes it so)
- Consequences are real and lasting
- Trauma affects characters going forward

## 9. Genre Conventions

**EMBRACE:**

1. **Cultivation progression milestones feel earned and significant** — breakthroughs matter, setbacks hurt, power is fought for

2. **Power hierarchies are real** — stronger cultivators can and will dominate weaker ones; this is how the world works

3. **Sect politics are complex** — factions, alliances, debts, grudges, all playing out

4. **Sexual openness is normalized** — exhibitionists, varied kinks, and open desires exist without the narrative treating them as shocking or unusual

5. **Characters have sexual agency** — people pursue what they want; attraction and desire are natural parts of life in this world

6. **Variety of characters with varied appetites** — from prudish to exhibitionist, vanilla to extreme, all exist and are valid

7. **Sexual encounters have consequences** — relationships form, jealousies arise, reputations shift, power dynamics matter in bed too

8. **The body is a cultivation tool** — dual cultivation, body refinement, physical transformation are all part of the system

**SUBVERT:**

1. **No passive harem magnetism** — MC doesn't accidentally attract everyone; connections are built through interaction and choice

2. **Sexual content serves narrative** — encounters reveal character, shift relationships, have stakes; not just fanservice

3. **Power ≠ sexual availability** — strong characters aren't automatically interested in MC; they have their own desires and standards

4. **Consent exists even in a brutal world** — or its absence is treated with appropriate weight, not glossed over as "how things are"

5. **Not everyone wants the MC** — attraction is specific, not universal protagonist-gravity

6. **Perverted ≠ comedic relief** — exhibitionists and kinksters are real characters with depth, goals, and inner lives; not just jokes

7. **Sexual trauma has real consequences** — it's not forgotten next scene; it shapes characters going forward

## 10. MC Treatment

**Competence Framing**: **Varies by domain**
- MC has strengths and weaknesses
- It should be possible to meet better, stronger, more talented people
- MC is not "the star" — just one person in a large world

**Plot Centrality**: **MC is swept up**
- Larger forces don't care about MC
- MC reacts to events until they have power to influence them
- Earning influence is part of the journey

**Growth Arc Style**: **Struggle and earn**
Every gain costs something. Nothing is given.

**Vulnerability** — everything checked:
- ✓ Can be outmatched and forced to flee
- ✓ Can be wrong about important things
- ✓ Can be manipulated without realizing
- ✓ Can be publicly humiliated
- ✓ Can lose social standing
- ✓ Can lose allies permanently
- ✓ Can be captured/imprisoned
- ✓ Can be enslaved
- ✓ Can be violated
- ✓ Can be permanently maimed
- ✓ Can die

**Plot Armor**: **None**
MC follows the same rules as everyone else. The narrative does not protect them.

## 11. Agent-Specific Summaries

### For NarrativeDirector

Use this Story Bible to calibrate:

1. Consequences stem from world logic and MC choices, not random events
2. The world does not revolve around MC — neither to help nor to hurt
3. Safe spaces are real until something in-world threatens them
4. Stats are stats. Suffering doesn't earn success.
5. There should be a way out if MC is clever — but "clever" means actually clever

3. Characters speak in their own voices based on who they are
4. The world is brutal but genuine connections exist
5. No softening moments to protect MC or reader comfort
