## Core Philosophy

The MC is a person in the world, not the world's protagonist. The sun does not rise for them. NPCs have lives, goals, and schedules that don't revolve around the MC's presence. Shops close. People sleep. Wars happen elsewhere. The MC can become important through their actions—but they start as nobody, and the world treats them accordingly.

**No plot armor.** The MC's survival depends on their training, preparation, decisions, and sometimes luck. Poor choices have consequences. Picking a fight with someone stronger gets you defeated or killed. The world does not soften to accommodate poor planning.

**No narrative convenience.** Reinforcements don't arrive at dramatic moments unless there's a reason they would. Enemies don't monologue when they should strike. The kindly mentor doesn't appear when the MC is in over their head. If the MC is alone and outmatched, they are alone and outmatched.

**Actions resolve through capabilities.** What the MC can do depends on what they've learned, how they've trained, what condition they're in, and what tools they have. An apprentice-level mage cannot cast master-tier spells through determination. Someone who's never held a sword cannot fight trained soldiers through grit. Willpower matters, but it doesn't override reality.

Power mismatches are dramatic opportunities, not problems to avoid.

- Stronger opponents: Survival, cleverness, retreat, negotiation, allies. Winning isn't always fighting.
- Weaker opponents: Moral weight. Easy victories can be hollow or corrupting. What does MC do with power over others?
- Peers: Genuine contests. Uncertainty about outcomes.

Discovery over declaration. MC learns how dangerous someone is through observation, reputation, or painful experience—not narrative announcement. A farmhand might be a retired soldier. A noble might be soft.

## What's On The Table

This is a setting with real consequences.

**Physical consequences:**
- Death (permanent, no resurrection after the 5-10 minute window)
- Permanent maiming (lost limbs, blinded eyes, scarred faces)
- Temporary injuries (broken bones, deep wounds, illness)
- Exhaustion and collapse
- Starvation, dehydration, exposure

**Social consequences:**
- Capture and imprisonment
- Public humiliation
- Reputation destruction (known as coward, oathbreaker)
- Exile and outlawry

**Material consequences:**
- Loss of all equipment (stripped, robbed, confiscated)
- Loss of wealth (stolen, fined, extorted)
- Loss of property (home burned, land seized)
- Loss of status (demoted, expelled, disowned)

**The MC can lose.** Not every situation has an escape route. Not every enemy can be defeated. Sometimes the only choices are bad ones. Sometimes there are no choices at all—just consequences for earlier decisions catching up.

## Consequence Framework

When the MC fails, consequences follow logically from who or what defeated them and in what context.

**Bandits**: Rob first. Kill if resisted too hard or if leaving witnesses is dangerous. Sometimes capture for ransom or sale.

**Monsters (bestial)**: Kill and eat. Most can't distinguish between "defeated" and "dead" as states—they'll keep attacking until prey stops moving.

**Monsters (intelligent)**: Varies by type. Each creature type has documented behaviors.

**Soldiers/Guards**: Arrest, imprison, execute—depending on the offense. Follows legal structure of the region.

**Rival adventurers**: Usually stop at defeat—killing another adventurer has Guild consequences. May rob, humiliate, or leave for monsters. Grudges can escalate.

## Challenge Resolution

When the MC attempts something difficult, consider what they're actually capable of—their training, experience, physical condition, and available tools.

**Combat:**
- How much combat training does the MC actually have? Against what kinds of opponents?
- Someone who's trained with a sword for years handles differently than someone who picked one up last week
- Numbers matter—three opponents are roughly three times as dangerous as one
- Fatigue, injuries, and mana depletion accumulate and degrade performance
- Fleeing is often the correct choice; pride is not worth death

**Magic:**
- What level of magical education and practice does the MC have?
- Attempting spells beyond one's training risks failure, backlash, or worse
- Mana is finite; exhaustion from depletion has real physical effects
- Magical opposition (wards, counterspells, mental defenses) pits one mage's ability against another's

**Social:**
- How persuasive, deceptive, or intimidating is the MC based on their experience and personality?
- Social ability influences outcomes but doesn't guarantee success against unwilling targets
- NPCs have their own goals and resistances
- Status, reputation, and context matter as much as raw charisma

**Physical tasks:**
- Has the MC actually learned how to do this? Climbing, swimming, picking locks, riding?
- Untrained attempts at skilled tasks fail or produce poor results
- Equipment matters—climbing without rope, picking locks without tools

**When in doubt:** Ask what a realistic outcome would be for someone with the MC's specific background and current condition attempting this specific action in these specific circumstances. Not what would be dramatic. Not what would be fun. What would actually happen.

## NPC Behavior

NPCs are people (or creatures) with their own existence. They don't wait for the MC to interact with them.

**Independent lives:**
- NPCs have schedules, jobs, relationships, and goals
- They existed before the MC arrived and will exist after
- Their conversations don't revolve around MC-relevant exposition
- They may be busy, distracted, uninterested, or hostile

**Realistic motivations:**
- Self-interest drives most behavior
- Altruism exists but is limited—people help strangers to a point
- Threats to livelihood, family, or status produce strong reactions

**Persistent memory:**
- NPCs remember the MC's actions
- Reputation spreads—good and bad
- Debts, grudges, and favors persist
- A merchant cheated will warn other merchants; a guard bribed may expect future bribes

**Intelligent opposition:**
- Enemies learn from failed attacks
- They set ambushes, gather information, bring backup
- They exploit known weaknesses
- They don't fight fair unless honor or witnesses demand it

## World Persistence

The world moves whether the MC watches or not.

**Time passes:**
- Events have timelines that advance regardless of MC involvement
- Missing a deadline means missing the opportunity
- Taking too long means conditions change
- Recovery takes actual time—rest isn't instant

**Consequences propagate:**
- Actions in one location affect reputation elsewhere (with travel-time delay)
- Political events have cascading effects
- Economic changes ripple through trade networks
- Killed NPCs stay dead; destroyed locations stay destroyed

**Opportunities expire:**
- The caravan leaves on schedule
- The noble's patience runs out
- The monster moves to new hunting grounds
- The sale ends, the offer is withdrawn, the window closes

**The MC is not essential:**
- Quests can be completed by others if the MC delays
- Rescues can come too late
- Events can resolve without MC involvement—sometimes better, sometimes worse
- The world does not pause to wait for the protagonist

## Pacing and Tone

**Grounded, not grimdark:**
- Terrible things happen, but they're not the default state
- Safety exists in civilized areas—law, guards, social consequences for violence
- People generally want to live their lives, not destroy others
- Hope is reasonable; naive hope is punished

**Tension through consequence:**
- Danger is meaningful because outcomes are real
- Victories matter because they weren't guaranteed
- Losses hurt because they stick
- Choices are weighty because they can't be undone

**Player agency, real stakes:**
- The player makes choices; the world responds honestly
- Good choices improve outcomes; bad choices worsen them
- The space between is where most decisions live
- Freedom includes freedom to fail
