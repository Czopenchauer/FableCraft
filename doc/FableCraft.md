# Fable Craft

FableCraft is text based Choose Your Own Adventure game allowing you to explore fantasy worlds, make choices, and
experience different storylines based on your decisions. World and story generation is powered by AI.

## Features

- Persistent Worlds: FableCrafts uses Knowledge Graphs to create persistent worlds that evolve based on player
  actions. On top of them is build RAG solution so the AI won't forget important details and start contradicting itself.
- No summaries, lorebooks, or other memory management tricks: FableCraft uses Knowledge Graphs to store and retrieve
  world
  information, allowing the AI to access relevant details without needing to summarize or condense information.

## Gameplay

The gameplay of FableCraft is typical CYOA style, with player making choices that affect the story's outcome. However,
the world and story are dynamically generated by AI based on player input, creating a unique experience each time.
There's no pre-written storylines or fixed paths - the narrative unfolds based on player decisions and AI creativity.
Compared to the traditional CYOA games, the world has to be first created before the adventure can begin. You, the
player, is the world builder as well as the adventurer.

### The World Generator (World and Character Setup)

At the start of the game, player is prompted to provide a brief description of the world they want to explore. This can
include details:

- Setting (e.g., medieval fantasy, futuristic sci-fi, post-apocalyptic)
- Physical world - geography, climate, notable locations, continents
- Magic and supernatural elements - types of magic, deities, legends
- Fauna and flora - notable creatures, plants, ecosystems
- Civilizations and settlements - kingdoms, cities, villages, factions, cultures
- Technology level - tools, weapons, transportation
- Economy and resources - trade goods, currencies, industries
- Knowledge and history - important historical events, myths, influential figures
- Conflicts and challenges - ongoing wars, political struggles, environmental threats
- Daily life and culture - customs, traditions, social norms
- Items and artifacts - notable objects, relics, treasures
- Laws and justice - legal systems, punishments, rights
- Notable NPCs - key characters, leaders, heroes, villains

Player also provides details about their character, main protagonist of the story:

- **Player character details** - name, background, skills, motivations
- Starting scene description - initial setting, situation, immediate objectives

Based on this input, FableCraft generates a rich and detailed world and return it to the user to review it. If user
wants to make changes, they can provide type these elements themself or prompt the AI to regenerate specific sections.\
If user accept the world, or better speaking, adventure is created by commiting it to the Knowledge Graph. After that,
player can start their adventure.

Not all of these details are required - player can provide as much or as little information as they want. The AI will
fill in the gaps and create a cohesive world based on the provided input. For example only setting and starting
scene can be provided, and the AI will generate the rest.

### The Adventure

The game is played through a series of text-based interactions. Player is presented with narrative descriptions of a
scene - event, along with a set of choices to make. Player can select one of the provided options or type their own
action.
The AI will then generate the outcome of the player's choice, advancing the story and updating the world state
accordingly. The game continues in this manner, with player making choices and the AI responding, until... well
infinitly :).

## How the AI Generates Content - Narrative Engine

These are two parts of generating content in FableCraft: the initial world and character setup, and the ongoing
narrative generation during the adventure. The first part, the World Generator, uses single LLM with detailed
prompts for each elements and generate them in logical order. For example before creating civilizations, it first
creates geography, climate, flora and fauna as it makes sense to first know what the world looks like before deciding
who lives there.

The interesting part is the second one - generating the ongoing narrative during the adventure. This is done using 
different components, plugins, working together to create a cohesive experience with central Narrative Generator 
coordinating them:
- **Narrative Generator**: Uses LLMs to generate narrative descriptions and outcomes based on the current world
  state and player actions. It shapes the narrative, create scenes, hidden objectives, plot twists, and overall
  story arc.
- **World State Manager**: Maintains the current state of the world using a Knowledge Graph, storing details about
  locations, characters, items, and events. It also works as the "searcher", retrieving relevant information as needed.
- **Actor Simulator**: Simulates the actions and reactions of NPCs based on their personalities, motivations, and the
  current world state.
- **World Crafter**: Responsible for generating world details, creating new locations, items, characters as the player
  explores and ensuring that they are consistent with the already established world. It works as the supplement for
  the Narrative Generator when it needs to expand the world.
